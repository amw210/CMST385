      <p id="bio">Tom MacDonald was born in Vancouver, Canada to LeeAnn MacDonald
				 on September 21, 1988. He is currently living in Los Angeles on a visa.
				 Best classified as a conscious rapper, he was also a professional wrestler
				 for RCW (Real Canadian Wrestling) from 2003 to 2009. Dating Nova Rockafeller
				 since 2017, they created a punk band together called GFBF. He may be seen
				 as an independent artist who doesn’t follow the mainstream stereotypes,
				 seeing himself as a visionary. His YouTube started gaining traction after
				 the release of songs such as, “Dear Rappers,” “Castles,” “Helluvit,” and
				 “WHITEBOY.” His music tackles a varying array of subjects including race,
				 mumble rap, drug use, and depression. He also has spoken on terrorism and
				 police brutality in his song “How The West Was Won,” a Tribute song to the
				 Paris attacks on November 13th, 2015.</p>
